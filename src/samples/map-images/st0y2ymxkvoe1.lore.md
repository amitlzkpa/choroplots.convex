The collapse of Indian civilization
🏛️ The great ancient cities (Delhi, Varanasi, Pataliputra) are abandoned ruins.

The former capitals of Indian kingdoms are now covered in jungle.

Palaces and temples are destroyed or abandoned, without a central authority to maintain them.

Historic trade routes have completely collapsed, and long-distance travel is almost impossible.

🛕 Indian religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism) are almost extinct.

The temples have either been devastated or are no longer used by anyone.

The ancient gods of India are still worshipped in some isolated villages, but without priests or sacred books.

The few survivors practice a primitive form of ancient worship, mixing rituals from the past with new superstitions.
